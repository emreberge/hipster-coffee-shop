* Fill in the wifi password
* FIll in the coffee price
* A rating for the place

Services that can locate vendors
--------------------------------

Features
--------
* Only add a shop if the phone is connected to wifi
* Auto add the wifi password to keychain (is it even possible)?
* Rate the coffee shops higher if someone the user trusts has rated it. For example, the user probably trusts the people he/she is following on Twitter.
